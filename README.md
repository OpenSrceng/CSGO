Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (2012) is the latest game of the Counter-Strike franchise, running on the Source engine. The game is available on PC, through Steam, as well as Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The game contains the well-known hostage and bomb scenarios and has several new game modes not included in its predecessors, including "Deathmatch", "Demolition", and "Arms Race". The Arms Race and Demolition game modes are based on the popular mod "Gungame".
New weapons have also been added: Molotov grenades, which create a pool of fire in the ground, Decoy grenades, which create fake weapon sounds, and a taser melee weapon, the Zeus x27.

Technology-wise, Cascaded Shadow Maps has been implemented, wherein outdoor lighting (which was previously handled by a light_environment entity and produced only static lighting) now casts harsh, directional shadow maps similar to env_projectedtexture.

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive introduces:

Real-Time outdoor shadow mapping using the env_cascade_light entity
Similar to env_projectedtexture, used to render harsh, dynamic outdoor shadows
Light-mapped Ambient Occlusion
Used to create Ambient Occlusion on Brushes/Displacements
Map Workshop
Used to download custom maps from the workshop
Phong shading on Brushes (added 29 April 2015)
Allows for the addition of Phong highlights on brushes lit by environment light
Anisotropic reflection emulation
Used on cubemaps to emulate anisotropic reflections
Normal Map blending
Used to blend together multiple normal maps
```
